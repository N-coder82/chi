## About The Project

A Reminders and that combines ChatGPT, weather and a simple interface perfect for power users into one, singular app. It is a GUI app made in Python. __I've never done a large project like this so please forgive me if I don't use pull requests in releases, etc. It's because I don't know the proper format or how to do it! I am always learning so hopefully I should get into the habit of things like this!__

## Built With

I made this with Python a simple, easy to use language, I also used a bit of C# for the windows download.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* python
* pytoexe (optional)

```sh
pip install pytoexe
```

### Installation

1. Get OpenAI and weatherapi.com API keys

2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/N-coder82/chi
```

3. Enter your OpenAI API key in `shell.py`

```python
openai.api_key = "sk-************************************************"

```
4. Enter your weatherapi.com API key in `shell.py`

```python
weatherapikey = "*******************************"

```

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/N-Coder82/chi/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/N-Coder82/chi/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes.
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Create individual PR for each suggestion.
* Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/N-Coder82/chi/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting your first idea as well.

### Creating A Pull Request


1. To create a branch, use git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>], where base-branch-name is optional and defaults to master. I'm going to create a new branch called pull-request-demo from the master branch and push it to github.
```shell
git checkout -b pull-request-demo
git push origin pull-request-demo
```

2. Go to the repository page on github. And click on "Pull Request" button in the repo header.

   Pick the branch you wish to have merged using the "Head branch" dropdown. You should leave the rest of the fields as is, unless you are working from a remote branch. In that case, just                  make sure that the base repo and base branch are set correctly.

   Enter a title and description for your pull request. Remember you can use Github Flavored Markdown in the description and comments

   Finally, click on the green "Send pull request" button to finish creating the pull request.
